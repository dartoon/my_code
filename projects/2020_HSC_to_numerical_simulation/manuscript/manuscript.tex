\begin{abstract}
We carry out a comparative analysis of the relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (BHs) and the stellar mass of their host galaxies (\mbh --\smass) at $0.2<z<1.7$ using well-matched observations and multiple state-of-the-art simulations (e.g., Massive Black II, Horizon-AGN, Illustris, TNG and a semi-analytic model). The observed sample consist of 646 uniformly-selected SDSS quasars ($0.2 < z < 0.8$) and 32 broad-line AGNs ($1.2<z<1.7$) with imaging from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) for the former and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the latter. To make fair comparisons, we first add realistic observational uncertainties to the simulation data and then construct a simulated sample in the same manner as the observations. Over the full redshift range, our analysis demonstrates that all simulations predict a level of intrinsic scatter of the scaling relations comparable to the observations which appear to agree with the dispersion of the local relation. 
Regarding the mean scaling relation, Horizon-AGN and TNG are in closest agreement with the observational data at both low and high redshift ($z\sim$ 0.2 and 1.5, respectively) while the other simulations show subtle differences within the uncertainties. 
For insight into the physics involved, the scatter of the scaling relation, seen in the SAM, is reduced by a factor of two and thus closer to the observations after adopting a new feedback model which considers the geometry of the AGN outflow. The consistency in the dispersion with redshift in our analysis lends support to the importance of both quasar and radio mode feedback prescriptions in the simulations. Finally, we investigate evolution as a function of stellar and \red{BH} mass, and argue that the most direct way to probe the co-evolution of galaxies and \red{BH}s is to increase the sensitivity, e.g., with JWST, thereby pushing to lower masses and minimizing possible biases arising from selection effects.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
The close correlations between \red{the mass of} supermassive black holes (\red{\mbh}) and the properties of their host galaxies (e.g., stellar mass\red{, \smass}) indicate a physical coupling during their joint evolution~\citep{Mag++98, F+M00, M+H03, H+R04, Gul++09}. To understand the nature of this connection, considerable efforts have been focused on measuring such correlations using broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) over a range of redshifts with the intention to determine how and when the correlation emerges and evolves over \red{cosmic time}. While, an {\it observed} evolution has been found \red{since redshift $z\sim2$ in galaxies with stellar mass \smass\ $\gtrsim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ \citep[e.g.,][]{Tre++04, Peng2006a,Tre++07,Woo++08,Bennert11,Park15, Ding2020, 2021arXiv210902751L} in} which the growth of BHs predates that of the host, other studies \red{\citep[e.g.,][]{Schramm2013, Sun2015} predict that} BHs grow commensurately with galaxies.
However, to understand the significance {\it intrinsic} evolution, it is necessary to take into account systematic uncertainties and the selection effects~\citep{Tre++07, Lauer2007, Schulze2014, Park15,Jahnke2009}. 

Various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the origin of the scaling relations. For example, AGN feedback is considered as one of the possible viable mechanisms. During this process, a fraction of the AGN energy is injected into its surrounding gas, which can then regulate the mass growth of the BH and its host. In this scenario, star formation is inhibited by the heating and unbinding of a significant amount of gas. Alternatively, the mass relations can be explained through an indirect connection in which AGN accretion and star formation are fed through a common \red{gas supply~\citep{Cen2015, Menci2016, angles_black_2017}. }Actually, even without any physical mechanisms, statistical convergence from galaxy assembly alone (i.e., dry mergers) could instill the observed correlations~\citep{Peng2007, Jahnke2011, Hirschmann2010}. However, as expected from the central limit theorem, a higher dispersion would appear in the scaling relations at high-$z$ compared to what is observed today. 

Numerical simulations provide an opportunity to further understand the connection between BHs and their host galaxies. For example, a comparison of scaling relations has been made using state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation ({\tt MassiveBlackII}) and observational measurements at  $0.3<z<1$ \citep[e.g., ][]{DeG++15}, which show a positive evolution (i.e., the mass growth of the BH growth predates that of its host). Further efforts are using large-volume simulations to investigate the scaling relations and find good agreement with the local relation with redshift evolution, 
including the Magneticum Pathfinder smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) Simulations~\citep{Steinborn2015}, the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments~(EAGLE) suite of SPH \red{simulations~\citep{Schaye2015, Crain2015, McAlpine2016},} Illustris moving-mesh \red{simulation~\citep{Genel2014, 2014MNRAS.444.1518V, Sijacki2015, Nelson2015, Li2019}, the Horizon-AGN simulation~\citep{2014MNRAS.444.1453D, 2016MNRAS.463.3948D, 2016MNRAS.460.2979V}, and the SIMBA simulation~\citep{Thomas2019, Dave2019}. }
In particular, the \mbh-\smass\ relation using BH populations using six large-scale cosmological simulations (i.e, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA) has been compared with observations in the local universe in a recent study~\citep{Habouzit2021}. However, these comparison works are limited by the observation data in terms of the sample size ($<$100) and redshift range (i.e., limited to the local universe).

For such comparisons using simulations, it is crucial to consider the systematic uncertainties and selection biases. A direct means to account for these is to apply the same effects and selection to the simulation products and make a forward comparison in the observational plane. In~\citet{Ding2020b}, a direct comparison has been performed using 32 X-ray-selected AGN at $1.2<z<1.7$ and a direct comparison with two state-of-the-art simulation efforts, including {\tt MassiveBlackII} (MBII) and a Semi-analytic Model \citep[SAM,][]{Menci2014, Menci2016}. The dispersion in the mass ratio between \red{BH} mass and stellar mass is significantly more consistent with the MBII prediction ($\sim0.3$~dex) favoring the hypothesis of AGN feedback being responsible for a causal link between the BH and its host galaxy.

In this study, we extend our previous work by adding recent measurements of hundreds of SDSS quasars at $0.2<z<0.8$ based on wide and deep HSC imaging from the Strategic Subaru Program, and comparing the observational measurements with that from simulations. Furthermore, we extend the simulated quasar populations by including MBII, SAM, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN. This paper is structured as follows. In Sections~\ref{sec:observations} and~\ref{sec:simulations}, we describe our observed and simulated samples. A direct comparison is performed and the result is presented in Section~\ref{sec:result}. The concluding remarks are presented in Section~\ref{sec:con}.

\section{Observational data set}
\label{sec:observations}
The observed sample consists of 646 uniformly-selected SDSS quasars at $0.2<z<0.8$, imaged by Subaru/HSC \citep{Li2021a}, and 32 quasars at $1.2<z<1.7$ as imaged by~\hst~\citep[][hereafter D20]{Ding2020}. The latter are selected from three deep-survey fields, namely COSMOS~\citep{Civano2016}, (E)-CDFS-S~\citep{Lehmer2005, Xue2011}, and SXDS~\citep{Ueda2008}. Further details of these two samples and their measurements are given below. 

\subsection{SDSS/HSC sample}\label{sec:hsc}
A sample of $\sim$5000 type-1 SDSS quasars from the DR14 catalog~\citep{Paris2018} at $0.2<z<1$ has been imaged by the high-resolution Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) wide area survey~\citep{Aihara2019} using Hyper Suprime-Cam~\citep{Miyazaki2018}. With accurate PSF models in five optical bands {\it grizy}, two-dimensional quasar-host decompositions have been \red{performed \citep[][]{Li2021a}} to obtain the flux and color of each quasar's host galaxy. The stare-of-the-art image modeling software {\tt lenstronomy} \citep{Birrer2015, Birrer2018, Birrer2021} is adopted to perform the modeling task. This approach is first developed by~\citet{Ding2020} and used to decompose the near-infrared emission of the HST sample (see next section). Having measured the host light in each band, the stellar mass of host galaxy is derived using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with CIGALE~\citep{Boquien2019}. Simulation tests are also performed to verify the fidelity of the \smass\ measurements. The statistical measurement error on \smass\ is at the $\sim$0.2~dex level. The values of \mbh\ are determined by~\citet{Rakshit2020} which are estimated based on the \hbeta-based measurements using the virial method~\citep{Peterson2004, Vestergaard2006}. The typical error of \mbh\ are estimated to be 0.4 dex. \red{The mass ranges for the entire sample are log(\smass) $\in$ [9.0, 11.5] $M_{\odot}$, and log(\mbh) $\in$  [6.5, 10.0] $M_{\odot}$)}.
 We refer the reader to~\citet{Li2021a} in the Section~4.2 for more details.

To avoid any potential biases related to the selection of the quasars, \citet{2021arXiv210902751L} isolated 877 sources which are uniformly selected based on their PSF-magnitudes, color cuts using single-epoch SDSS photometry and the value of the measured \smass. Specifically, we use the {\it ugri} color-selected sample (228 sources) from SDSS I/II~\citep{Richards2002}, and the CORE sample from SDSS BOSS (408 sources) and eBOSS (241 sources) surveys~\citep{Ross2013, Myers2015} (hereafter the uniform sample). These samples are initially selected based on PSF-magnitude cuts of $15 < i < 19.1$ (for {\it ugri}), and $i > 17.8$ and $g, r < 22.0$ (for CORE). Furthermore, a limit on \smass\ is set to assure the detection of the host, especially since the rate and accuracy of detection is higher when \smass\ is increasing, resulting in a final sample of 646 quasars. These selections will be adopted in an equivalent manner to the simulated samples to mitigate selection effects thus allowing the fair comparison.

\subsection{HST sample}

A sample of 32 HST-observed AGN systems across the redshift range $1.2<z<1.7$ are selected from three deep-survey fields (COSMOS, (E)-CDFS-S, and SXDS). HSC/WFC3 IR camera is used to obtain the high-resolution imaging data (HST program GO-15115, PI: John Silverman) with six position dither pattern and a total exposure time $\sim$2348~s. The filters F125W ($1.2<z<1.44$) and F140W ($1.44<z<1.7$) were employed, according to the redshift of each target to bracket the 4000~\AA~break.  The AGN images are analyzed and decomposed to infer the host galaxies fluxes using the approach developed by D20 based on {\tt lenstronomy}. The HST ACS/F814W imaging data for 21/32 of the AGNs is also used to infer the host color. The results show that stellar templates of 1 and 0.625~Gyr can match the sample color at $z<1.44$ and $z>1.44$, respectively (see Figure 5 in D20). These best-fit models are used to estimate the stellar masses of the host galaxies. \mbh\ is determined by \citet{Schulze2018} using near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the broad \halpha\ emission line with the recipe provided by~\citet{Vestergaard2006}, in a consistent manner to that adopted for HSC sample. \red{The mass ranges for the HST sample are log(\smass) $\in$ [9.5, 11.0] $M_{\odot}$, and log(\mbh) $\in$  [7.5, 9.0] $M_{\odot}$)}.
 We refer the reader to D20 for a more detailed description of the analysis. 

The measurements of the \mbh-\smass\ relations for both the HST and HSC samples are obtained with a consistent approach. Thus, we expect the measurement errors of these two samples to be at a comparable level (i.e., $\Delta$\mbh$=0.4~$dex, $\Delta$\smass$=0.2~$dex). 
Indeed, the two samples are consistent with a lack of evolution in the mass ratio~\citep[see Figure 6 of][]{2021arXiv210902751L}, even though the sample selection is slightly different.

\end{deluxetable*}


\section{Simulations and comparison strategy}
\todo{Uniform the descriptions of the simulations to lack homogeneity. (Illustris has star formation threshold). Re-write the section and provide the same information}
\label{sec:simulations}
We introduce the simulation samples that are adopted in this section. All the simulation are based on the larger-scale cosmological simulations, except the Semianalytic Model (SAM) simulation (see Section~\ref{subsec:SAM}). In Table~\ref{tab:sim_sum}, we summarized the key elements for each hydrodynamic simulation being considered.

\red{Note that each simulation adopt either a  \cite{2003PASP..115..763C} or a \cite{1955ApJ...121..161S} IMF. To make a self-consistent comparison, we ensure that the adopted IMF for both the simulation and the observation are the same. The assumed IMF is needed to obtain the mass-to-light ratio and convert the observed luminosity to stellar mass to perform the comparison. For numerical simulation, the mass is the base material which is IMF independent.}


\subsection{{\tt MassiveBlackII} (MBII)}\label{subsec:MBII}
MBII is a high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that has a box size of $(142.7~\mathrm{cMpc})^3$
and $2\times1792^3$ particles. \todo{Aklant: Please answer what is the factor 2 here. A twin box with 1793$^3$ each?} The simulation is based on smooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) code \texttt{P-GADGET}, a hybrid version of the parallel code {\tt GADGET}~\citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S}. The base cosmology parameters are based on the WMAP7 results~\citep{2011ApJS..192...18K}. For dark matter and gas, the mass resolutions are $1.57\times 10^7~M_{\odot}$ and $3.14\times 10^6~M_{\odot}$, respectively. The simulation includes a full modeling of gravity plus gas hydrodynamics, with a wide range of subgrid recipes to model the star formation~\citep{2003MNRAS.339..289S}, BH growth, and the feedback process~\citep{2005Natur.433..604D}. Halos were identified using a friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder~\citep{1985ApJ...292..371D}. Galaxies are identified with the stellar matter components of subhalos; these subhalos are identified using {\tt SUBFIND} within the halos~\citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S}.

To model supermassive \red{BH, the initial} seed with mass $5\times 10^{5}~M_{\odot}/h$ are inserted into halos of mass $\gtrsim 5\times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}/h$. Once seeded, BH growth via gas accretion is assigned at a rate of $\dot{M}_{BH}={4\pi G^2 M_{BH}^2 \rho}/{(c_s^2+v_{BH}^2)^{3/2}}$ where $\rho$ and $c_s$ are the density and sound speed of the interstellar medium (ISM) gas at cold phase; $v_{BH}$ is the relative velocity between the BH and its surrounding gas. Note that unlike several previous works, the accretion rate in MBII adopt the prescription in~\citet{Pelupessy2007} which does not include any artificial boost factor. The accreted gas is released as radiation at a radiative efficiency of 10\%. A fraction of 5\% of the radiated energy thermally couples to the surrounding gas as \red{BH} (or AGN) feedback~\citep{2005Natur.433..604D}. A mildly super-Eddington (two times Eddington rate) is allowed. Due to resolution limitations, BH dynamics cannot be self-consistently modeled in the simulations. Two BHs are considered to be merged when their separation distance is below the simulation spatial resolution (i.e., the SPH smoothing length) and their relative speeds are lower than the local sound speed of the medium.

As a common practice, the stellar mass is obtained by using a 3D spherical aperture of 30~kpc to represent the observed stellar mass.
We adopt this definition of stellar masses for all \red{larger-scale cosmological} simulations described in the following sections, \red{except for Horizon-AGN which use total mass (see Section~\ref{subsec:Horizon}) for details.}  Using this definition, \citet{Pillepich2018} has shown that the corresponding stellar mass function is consistent with the observational measure. Even more, the stellar mass using this 3D aperture can achieve good agreement to those measured within the Petrosian radii in observational studies~\citep{Schaye2015}. For further details of MBII simulation, we refer the reader to~\citet{Khandai2015}.

\subsection{Illustris}
The Illustris Project is another large scale hydrodynamics simulation, introduced \red{in~\citet{Genel2014, 2014MNRAS.444.1518V, 2014Natur.509..177V, Sijacki2015, Nelson2015}.} The simulation consist of a volume of (106.5 cMpc)$^3$~(slightly smaller than MassiveBlack II), 
and was run with the moving Voronoi mesh code {\tt Arepo}~\citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S} with a base cosmology adopted from WMAP9 results~\citep{2013ApJS..208...19H}. Besides gravity and gas hydrodynamics, the simulation calculates the astrophysical processes ~\citep{2013MNRAS.436.3031V, 2014MNRAS.438.1985T} that includes gas cooling and star formation~(with a density threshold of 0.13 cm$^{-3}$, \citealt{2003MNRAS.339..289S}), stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, kinetic stellar feedback by SNe activity, BH growth~(accretion and merging), and AGN feedback.

BHs are seeded with an initial mass of $1 \times 10^5~M_{\odot}/h$ when a halo exceeds a mass of $5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}/h$. BHs then grow via accretion described by the Eddington limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism ($\alpha4\pi G^2M_{BH}^2 \rho/c_s^3$), as well as mergers with other BHs. The boost factor $\alpha=100$ is introduced to account for the unresolved multiphase ISM~\citep{Springel2005, 2009MNRAS.398...53B}, which is otherwise expected to underestimate the density around the BHs. Lastly, accreting \red{BH}s radiate with a bolometric luminosity given by $\epsilon_r \dot{M}_{BH}c^2$, where $\dot{M}_{BH}$ is the mass accretion rate and $\epsilon_r=0.2$ is the radiative efficiency.

The AGN feedback consists of three components, namely quasar-mode, radio-mode and radiative feedback. In the quasar-mode which holds for BHs with Eddington ratio $>0.01$, the AGNs deposit $5\%$~(quasar-mode feedback efficiency) of their released energy into the surrounding gas as thermal energy. For Eddington ratios $<0.01$, the AGN feedback is in radio-mode where the thermal energy is released as hot bubbles with a radius of $\sim$ 100~kpc at intervals between which the BH mass grows by a fixed fraction. \todo{Aklant: Referee asks: are these irregular intervals included in the feedback modeling, or simply due to the time-varying accretion onto BHs? does it mean that the BH accretion is not modeled by the Bondi accretion between AGN feedback events?} \aklant{\bf{They are irregular simply because the BH mass growth is non- uniform. So it takes different amounts of time for the BH to grow by a fixed fraction. Bondi accretion is happening at all times. I have now removed the word `irregular' from this statement.}} The energy of the bubbles is given by $\epsilon_m \epsilon_r \delta M_{BH} c^2$ where $\delta M_{BH}$ is the change in BH mass within the last time interval, and $\epsilon_m=0.35$ is the radio-mode feedback efficiency. Lastly, the radiative feedback mode is implemented by modifying the heating and cooling rates of the gas in the presence of radiation from all surrounding AGN.

\subsection{IllustrisTNG}
{\it The Next Generation Illustris Simulations} \red{(IllustrisTNG, hereafter, TNG)~\citep{2018MNRAS.475..676S, Pillepich2018, Naiman2018, Marinacci2018, Nelson2018}} are a suite of magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation in large cosmological volumes. It builds upon the scientific achievements of the Illustris simulation with improvements upon Illustris by 1) extending the mass range of the simulated galaxies and haloes, 2) adopting an improved numerical and astrophysical modeling, and 3) addressing the identified shortcomings of the previous generation simulations. \red{Note that TNG simulations employ a modified version of the Bondi formalism, with $c_s$ explicitly including a B term for these magneto-hydro simulations.}

The TNG100 and TNG300 have a volume of (100~cMpc)$^3$ and (300~cMpc)$^3$, respectively. The adopted cosmological parameters are updates by the Planck result~\citep{2016A&A...594A..13P}.
The gas cooling and star formation prescriptions are broadly similar to the Illustris model. However significant updates have been made to the stellar feedback model~(more details in \citealt{2018MNRAS.473.4077P}).
BH seeds with initial mass of $8 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}/h$ are placed in Dark matter halos with a mass exceeding $5 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}/h$. Notably, the seed mass is one order of magnitude higher than in the Illustris simulation. The BH accretion also follows the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism, but without any boost factor~(unlike Illustris). Accreting \red{BH}s release energy with a radiative efficiency of 0.2~(same as Illustris). The inclusion of the magnetic fields can affect the relationship between the BHs and their host galaxies properties; the \mbh-\smass\ mean relation is higher with magnetic fields~\citep{2018MNRAS.473.4077P}. 

The AGN feedback occurs in thermal, radio, and radiative modes. For high accretion rates, the feedback implementation is the same as Illustris i.e., thermal energy is injected in the surroundings of the accreting BHs. However, at low accretion rates, the feedback implementation is substantially different from Illustris. Instead of releasing hot bubbles, this feedback mode in TNG is purely kinetic. In particular, there is a directional injection of momentum along a randomly chosen direction~\citep{2017MNRAS.465.3291W, 2018MNRAS.479.4056W} at irregular intervals. The transition between the two feedback modes is also different from Illustris, and is set by the minimum value of 0.1 and $2 \times 10 ^{-3} \times (M_{BH} / 10^8~M_{\odot})$. Additionally, the radiative feedback implemented in Illustris~(summarized in the previous section) is also present in TNG. Lastly, the galaxy stellar mass in Illustris-TNG is obtained in a similar manner to that of Illustris.

\subsection{Horizon-AGN}\label{subsec:Horizon}
The simulation Horizon-AGN~\citep{2014MNRAS.444.1453D, 2016MNRAS.463.3948D} has a volume of 142 cMpc$^3$ and was generated using the adaptive mesh refinement code {\tt Ramses}~\citep{2002A&A...385..337T} with a $\Lambda$CDM model based on WMAP7~\citep{2011ApJS..192...18K} cosmological results. The dark matter particle mass is $8\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$. The stellar particle mass is $2\times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and the MBH seed mass is $10^5 M_{\odot}$. Adaptive mesh refinement is permitted down to $\Delta x=1$~kpc, and, if the total mass in a cell becomes greater than 8 times the initial mass resolution, it is performed in a quasi-Lagrangian manner. Collisionless particles (dark matter and star particles) are evolved using a particle-mesh solver with a cloud-in-cell interpolation.

The simulation includes gas cooling down to $10^4\, \rm K$ \citep{sutherland&dopita93}, and stochastic star formation with a constant star formation efficiency $\epsilon_*=0.02$, which occurs in regions where the gas number density exceeds the star formation threshold $n_0 = 0.1\,\rm H\, cm^{-3}$. %A Salpeter IMF is assumed. 
\red{Stellar feedback} is modeled as mechanical energy injection from Type Ia SNe, Type II SNe and stellar winds, with the metal enrichment from these sources.

Differing from simulations presented above, Horizon-AGN does not use a fixed threshold in the dark matter halo mass to seed BHs.  BHs are seeded with a mass of $10^5 M_\odot$ in cells, with gas density above $n_0$ and stellar velocity dispersion larger than $100 \,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. An exclusion radius is imposed so that no BH seed is formed at less than 50 ckpc from an existing BH. After $z = 1.5$, new BHs are prevented from forming. At these subsequent times, all the progenitors of the \smass$>10^{10} M_{\odot}$ galaxies at $z = 0$ should be formed and seeded with BHs~\citep{2016MNRAS.460.2979V}.  BH accretion is computed using the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism with a boost factor $\alpha = (\rho/\rho_0)^2$ when the density $\rho$ is higher than the resolution-dependent threshold $\rho_0$. Otherwise, the boost factor is fixed as unity~\citep{2009MNRAS.398...53B}.

Horizon-AGN includes two modes of AGN feedback. In the quasar mode ($f_{\rm Edd}>0.01$), thermal energy is isotropically released within a sphere of radius a few resolution elements. The energy deposition rate is $\dot{E}_{\rm AGN} = 0.015 \dot{M}_{\rm BH} c^2$. In the radio mode, energy is injected into a bipolar  outflow  with  a  velocity  of  $10^4\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, to  mimic the  formation  of  a  jet.  The  energy  rate  in  this  mode is $\dot{E}_{\rm AGN} = 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm BH} c^2$.  The  technical  details  of  BH  formation,  growth  and AGN  feedback  modeling  of  Horizon-AGN  can be found in~\citet{2012MNRAS.420.2662D}.

We identify galaxies applying the AdaptaHOP structure finder \citep{Aubert+04,Tweed+09} to the star particle distribution.  Galaxies are identified using a local threshold of 178 times the average matter density, with the local density of individual particles calculated using the 20 nearest neighbours. Only galaxies with more than 50 particles are considered. \red{Identified with this approach, for Horizon-AGN, the adopted galaxy mass corresponds to the total stellar mass of a galaxy, which is different than the other hydrodynamic simulations (i.e., within a 3D 30~kpc spherical aperture). This definition of stellar mass is commonly used in Horizon-AGN, whose stellar mass function is known~\citep{2017MNRAS.467.4739K}} to be in good agreement with observations.

\subsection{Semi-analytic Model (SAM)}\label{subsec:SAM}
We highlight the main points of the simulation with respect to our study; for more detail, a full description of the SAM can be found in~\citet{Menci2016} which is based on an earlier semi-analytic model introduced in~\citet{Menci2014}. The specific version adopted here differs from the one presented in the above papers since it implements a new, detailed description of AGN feedback, as discussed in detail below.

For dark matter halos that merge with a larger halo, the impact of dynamical friction is assessed to define whether the halo will survive as a satellite or sink to the center of the dominant galaxy which increases its mass. The binary interactions (fly-bys and mergers), among satellite sub-halos, are  also described by the model. In each halo, we compute the fraction of gas which cools because of the atomic processes and settles into a disk~\citep{Mo1998}. The stars are converted from the gas through three channels: (1) quiescent star formation with long time scales: $\sim1$~Gyr; (2) starbursts following galaxy interactions with timescales $\lesssim 100$~Myr, according to BH feeding; \todo{Nicola: the link between BH feeding and star formation channels in this sentence is not clear.} (3) the loss of angular momentum triggered by the internal disk instabilities causing the gas inflows to the center, resulting in stimulated star formation (as well as BH accretion). The stellar feedback is also considered by calculating the energy released by the supernovae associated with the total star formation which returns a fraction of the disk gas into a hot phase. %A Salpeter IMF is adopted in the SAM simulation. 
\red{A $\Lambda$CDM power} spectrum of perturbations with a total matter density parameter $\Omega_0=0.3$, a baryon density parameter 
$\Omega_b=0.04$, a dark energy density parameter $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, and a Hubble constant $h$=0.7 is adopted.

{We assume BH seed $M_{seed}=100\,M_{\odot}$~\citep{Madau2001}  to be initially present in all galaxy progenitors at the initial redshift $z=15$. This constitutes an approximate way of rendering the effect of the collapse of PopIII stars. However, the detailed value of $M_{seed}$ has a negligible impact on the final BH masses as long as they remain in the range $M_{seed}=50-500\,M_{\odot}$.
}

The BH accretion is based on both interaction-driven and disk instability feeding modes.
The SAM adopted here implements a new and improved  model for the AGN feedback with respect to the previous versions~\citep{Menci2008}. In both versions, the basic assumption is that fast winds with velocity up to $10^{-1}c$ observed in the central regions of AGNs~\citep{Chartas2002, Pounds2003}  result in  supersonic outflows that compress the gas into a blast wave terminated by a leading shock front. This  moves outward with a lower but still supersonic speed, and sweeps out the surrounding medium. However, while in the earlier version of the SAM~\citep{Menci2016} the blast wave is assumed to expand into an isotropically distributed medium, in the new description of AGN feedback~\citep{Menci2019} the full two-dimensional structure of the gas disc and of the expanding blast wave is followed in detail. The main physical difference is that in the new model the large density of gas along the plane of the disc causes the blast wave expansion to stall in such a direction, while it expands with large velocities in the vertical direction. The resulting strong dependence of the total (integrated over directions) outflow rate on the AGN luminosity $L_{AGN}$ and on the gas content of the galaxy $M_{gas}$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SAM}. Such a new AGN feedback model has been tested in detail against a state-of-the-art compilation of observed outflows in 19 galaxies with different measured gas and dynamical masses~\citep{Fiore2017}, allowing for a detailed, one-by-one comparison with the model predictions. This well tested AGN feedback model allowed us to derive, for each simulated galaxy in the SAM,  the outflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions with respect to the plane of the disc.



\subsection{Application of observational measurement error and selection effects}\label{subsec:add_obs_eff}
To make direct comparisons with observations, we add measurement errors and apply the equivalent selection to the simulated samples. We first inject random noise to the simulated catalog to mimic the scatter caused by measurement error. As mentioned above, \smass\ and \mbh\ for HSC and HST samples are measured with a similar approach; thus their uncertainty levels are expected to be equivalent. We assume the following measurement uncertainties that are added as random noise: $\Delta$\mbh$ = 0.4~$dex, $\Delta$\smass$ = \red{0.2}~$dex, and $\Delta L_{\rm bol} = 0.03~$dex. \red{Since the selection of the simulation sample based on $L_{\rm bol}$ has limited effects in this study (see the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:dis} and Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_nochange} for details), the AGN variability correction is not considered.}


We then apply restrictions on the noise-injected simulation to mimic selection effects as present in the observational data. Since the HSC and HST samples have their own selection function, we apply different selection criteria to the simulation as follows:

\red{Comparing with} HSC sample: (1) The observed sample consists of type-1 AGN, and thus the simulated sample should match the relationship between \mbh-$L_{\rm bol}$ as seen in the HSC sample. We use MBII to demonstrate the importance of matching the sample selection (Figure~\ref{fig:selection}--{\it \red{left}}). (2) The $i$-band magnitude of the AGN are bright (see Section~\ref{sec:hsc}). 
%The specific selection is made as follows: for systems at $z<0.5$ and $z>0.5$, the AGN $i$-band magnitude is required to be brighter than 20.5 mag and 22.0 mag, respectively.
\red{The specific selection is made as follows: a value of AGN $i$-band magnitude is selected to make the sample selection so that the $L_{\rm bol}$ distribution is similar to the observation (see Section~\ref{sec:dis} for details). }
Since the simulations do not provide the observed AGN magnitude, we adopt a simulated rest-frame magnitude or L$_{\rm 5100}$ and assume the quasar continuum as a single power-law with an index of $\alpha_\nu=-0.44$~\citep{2001AJ....122..549V} to calculate the observed $i$-band magnitude.
 3)~Following the HSC selection, we require the \smass\ value to be above a certain level (according to their redshift) to assure an accurate measurement. Finally, the HSC sample is split into three redshift bins for making comparison which are $0.2<z<0.4$, $0.4<z<0.6$, and $0.6<z<0.8$.
 
\red{Comparing with} HST sample: Simulated AGN systems are selected only when they match the  \mbh-$L_{\rm bol}$ targeting window which is the same as the observational selection (see Figure~\ref{fig:selection}--{\it right} using MBII as an example). Note that the selection of the HST sample has a hard cut on the \mbh\ values (i.e., \red{log(\mbh)} between [7.7, 8.6] $M_{\odot}$). The HST sample covers the higher redshift range $1.2<z<1.7$, which is considered as a single redshift bin to make the comparison with the simulations at $z=1.5$.

\section{Results} \label{sec:result}
%\todo{Explain the offset depends.}
\red{For comparison purpose, the local scaling relation introduced by D20 (e.g., \mbh$=0.98$\smass$-2.56$, Chabrier IMF based\footnote{Since different simulations adopt either a Chabrier or a Salpeter IMF, we use the local relation and \smass\ of the observational data that are based on the same IMF thus a comparison between the observations and simulations are self-consistent.}) is adopted as the fiducial relation to assess relative offsets and differences in dispersion. This local relation is derived by fitting the \mbh-\smass\ relations using 55 local galaxies by~\citet{Bennert++2011} and \citet{H+R04}, in which \smass\ measurements are Chabrier IMF based.}
\red{For each sample, we focus on the \mbh\ residuals\footnote{The value of the slope for the local sample is close to 1, and thus if taking the \smass\ to calculate the residual for each system, the offset value remains the same.} (i.e., the offset to the local relation along the $y$-axis) and calculating their mean and the standard deviation to make comparisons with the observation.}

\red{In Figure~\ref{fig:comparsion}, we present the mass scaling relation \mbh--\smass\ for both the observations and simulations for direct comparison. For the simulation data, both the initial sample and the ones after observational effect (i.e., inject observational noise correction, and apply equivalent selection) are show in the figure. 
Note that there are three types of offset value that can be collected for the simulation sample: the initial offset, the offset with selection effect, and the offset with noise injection and selection effect. For the initial offset, it has been known~\citep[e.g.,][Figure 2]{Habouzit2021} and can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:comparsion} that the initial offset values vary at different stellar mass range, and thus the mean and standard derivation could not represent the entire distribution.}
\red{In this work, we focus on the other two offset value distributions, i.e., considering selection effect but with/without noise correction. To aid in visualization of the differences among the various simulations compared to the observed sample, we show the distribution of offsets (in terms of the $\Delta{\rm log}$\mbh) as histograms in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}.  Each panel presents a different redshift range. In addition, the values of the central offset and scatter for before and after considering the noise are presented in Table~\ref{tab:sum}. The interpolations and the comparison with the observations are presented in the rest of this section.}

\end{figure*} 

\subsection{Dispersion}

Our results show that almost all simulations can produce scatter which is consistent with the observations across all redshifts examined (Figures~\ref{fig:comparsion}~and~\ref{fig:offsets}) --- for the simulated samples at $z<1$, this level of scatter is $\sim0.5$~dex, while at $z>1$, it is $\sim0.3$~dex. Note that the HST sample $z>1$ has a narrow selection window based on \mbh\ (see Figure~\ref{fig:selection}~bottom), causing the observed scatter to be smaller than that of the HSC sample at $z<1$. At all redshifts, we recognize that the observed scatter is dominated by measurement uncertainties in the data. 

An understanding of how much of the scatter derives from random noise can help us to determine the {\it intrinsic} scatter in the scaling relation. To this end, we measure the scatter of the simulation sample without injecting random noise but adopting the same selection window for both $z<1$ and $z>1$ samples to infer the central offset and scatter. We find that the intrinsic scatter is at a level of $\sim0.15-0.2$ dex for both $z<1$ and $z>1$ (see Table~\ref{tab:sum}). These levels are consistent with the {\it intrinsic} scatter as estimated using observation data alone~\citep{Ding2020, 2021arXiv210902751L}. Furthermore, the intrinsic scatter appears to be independent of redshift since the observations and simulations all follow the observed trend with redshift expected to be due to selection effects (Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_vz}). This suggests that the tight scaling relation may not be the result of a pure stochastic process, i.e., random mergers. However, the scatter is affected by sample selection, and thus these levels can only be taken as an approximation of the true intrinsic scatter.

\subsection{Global offsets}\label{subsec:offset}
We examine the offsets to understand whether the simulations deviate or not from the {\it observed} scaling relation with particular attention to changes with redshift. Considering the values given in Table~\ref{tab:sum} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_vz}, over the lower redshift range $z<0.6$, Illustris and Horizon-AGN predict {\it observed} \mbh\ offsets consistent with the observation data (at a level of $\lesssim0.1$~dex). At higher redshift $0.6<z<1.5$, the simulations SAM, TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN follow the {\it observed} evolution. These results are consistent with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test performed using the offset distributions between each simulated sample and the observed sample --- the p-values are given in Table~\ref{tab:pvalue} showing that Horizon-AGN and Illustris have a good statistical match to the scaling relation at $z<0.6$ (i.e., p-value $> 0.1$), while the TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN simulation do well at $z>0.6$. 
\red{We also see that, except MBII and Horizon-AGN, all the other simulations have the mass offset that are decreasing from $z=0.2$ to $z=0.6$, while the observations have offset value increase with redshift all the way up to $z\sim1.5$. However, this inconsistency is well below the $1-\sigma$ scatter level.}
Overall, we find that the mass \red{correlation} between \red{supermassive BH}s and their host galaxies are generally consistent between observations and simulations with some subtle differences which are not at the level of concern for this present study.

\subsection{Trends with stellar mass}
In Figure~\ref{fig:deltaMM}, we investigate how the offset values are correlated with stellar mass. Here, we focus on the sample at $z\sim0.7$. The other redshift bins at $z<1$, where there is a large observation sample from HSC, show similar trends. We include the intrinsic values from the simulations in the figures to address how the observational effects (i.e., random noise and selection) change the observed scaling relations and offsets. First, considering the observed quasar sample (same in each panel), there is a trend for which \red{BH}s have masses further offset from their stellar mass with decreasing stellar mass. This trend is not seen in any of the simulations after noise and selection effects have been applied. Given the level of uncertainties in the mean offsets of the observed sample, we do not try to interpret this trend any further in this study.

Interestingly, we notice that MBII and Illustris have \red{BH}s intrinsically under-massive relative to their galaxies at the lower masses that reach the \red{D20 local scaling} relation at higher masses. In contrast, TNG and Horizon-AGN have \red{BH}s slightly elevated from \red{D20} local relation at most masses. These differences between simulations present two different scenarios, either one where the \red{BH}s come later or co-evolution with the two growing in tandem. Considering the former scenario, Illustris show the strongest trend with stellar mass. In fact, after noise and selection is applied, the simulated sample exhibits very small offsets which agree remarkably well with the observed data. \red{Upon this, one interpretation is that depending on the BH population in the Universe, the observations of AGN such as our HSC sample, do not inform us of the true \mbh\ offsets as a function of \smass.}  This result underscores the importance of taking into account errors and selection --- without accounting for those, one could erroneously interpret an apparent trend as evolution in the opposite sense as the true one. The most direct way to circumvent these issues is to probe lower masses (\smass\  $<10^{10}M_{\odot}$) using a more sensitive instrument, such as JWST~\citep{Habouzit2022} across this redshift range \citep[see also][]{2011MNRAS.417.2085V}.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:dis}
%\todo{Discussion when shift offset as z=0.3. P11}
\red{In our comparison work, the mass offsets are compared to the relation derived in the local Universe. In fact, the different simulations could have different mean relations at $z=0$~\citep[e.g.,][]{Habouzit2021}. The interpretation of how BH mass offset of the simulation increasing with redshift with respect to the D20 local scaling relation can be different than using the simulations' own local relation. Moreover, the stellar mass of the Horizon-AGN sample is the total mass; while all the other hydrodynamic simulations' stellar mass values are determined within the 3D 30 kpc spherical aperture. Thus, in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_vz_shiftz03} we manually shift all the simulation's relation to as the same to the observation at $z=0.3$, where the offset evolution trend of each sample can be seen more clear. In general, the new result show that the evolution for the simulations are consistent with our interpretations in Section~\ref{subsec:offset}. This result can be expected since most of the simulation have demonstrated good offset match to the observation at redshift $z=0.3$.}

\red{We collected all the available sample in the simulation to perform the comparison, and final number of points that used to compare with observation are not by our design. Despite that the observational samples are volume-unlimited and the simulated sample are thus not volume-matched, fortunately, the volume of all the simulation appears to be sufficient $-$ all of the simulation can produce similar amount (or more) data points to compare with the observation (see Figure~\ref{fig:comparsion}). Also, the similar results are inferred using smaller and larger volume simulation, i.e., TNG100 and TNG300, which reflect the fact that the simulation's volume has reached to a sufficient level to be for this comparison work.}

\red{To avoid any possible bias raised by sample mismatch, we designed our selection in Section~\ref{subsec:add_obs_eff} so that the distribution of $L_{\rm bol}$ and \mbh\ are similar. We also assured that the \smass\ is compared at a similar range. Furthermore, we tested to change our selection so that a different $L_{\rm bol}$ distribution is finally adopted in the simulation. The result shows that the offset distribution of all the simulations are almost identical (see demonstrations in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_nochange}). This test implies that our comparison results are very robust; even considering the situation of AGN variability ($10-20\%$ level flux variation) and obscuration (i.e., removing a certain fraction of the sample), our result should keep the same.

Also, since in TNG100 the BH growth is more efficient, the BH mass function in TNG100 is found to be at higher normalization at low BH mass end.

However, since the compared samples have been processed with selection effect and/or random noise injection, such a difference became very slight.}

\red{We considered all the known observational effects, including the sample selection and random noise injection, and applied to the first-hand products of the simulation in order to directly compare with observations. Our result shows that the scatter between observation and simulation are very similar. Considering that the observation and simulation sample has went through the same observational process, this result is {\it consistent} with the fact that the intrinsic of the simulation (i.e., the first-hand product) and the observation are similar. Of course, there are limitations in our comparisons and this {\it consistency} doesn't necessarily mean their intrinsic must only be the same. On the one hand, there is always unknown-unknown in the observational effects that haven't applied to the simulation yet. On the other hand, even the state-of-the-art simulations could not capture all the physical aspects that impact the scatter. For example, the spin of BHs is not modeled in the simulation which could change the scatter since the spin affects to both the accretion the energy that can be released by AGN feedback \citep{Dubois2014, 2019MNRAS.490.4133B, Habouzit2021} at some level. Even though the spin effect is still not well known and the study of the spin effect is beyond the scope of this paper, the comparison work is worth to be done in the future once the simulations consider spin.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:con}
We compared the observed scaling relation \mbh-\smass\ with the predictions from numerical simulations. The observation data are composed of 626 quasars at $0.2 < z < 0.8$ imaged by HSC and 32 X-ray-selected quasars at $1.2 < z < 1.7$ imaged by HST. The simulations include a semi-analytic model (SAM) and five hydrodynamic simulations, i.e., MBII, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN. We carried out the comparisons in the observed parameter space to account for uncertainties and selection effects. To achieve this, we first injected random errors with the same observational uncertainty to the simulation, and then adopted the same selection condition to the simulation data (see Figure~\ref{fig:selection}). Finally, we adopted the scaling relation from the local universe as our reference and performed comparisons using the scatter of the measurements and their central offset to the \red{D20 local scaling} relation. Our main results are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}The {\it observed} scatter predicted by the simulations is consistent with the observational measurements, i.e., $\sim0.5$~dex at $z<1$ and $\sim0.3$~dex at $z>1$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_vz} and Table~\ref{tab:sum}). This result indicates that the simulated and observed samples have consistent {\it intrinsic} scatter.

\item{}To understand how much the {\it observed} scatter is dominated by random observational error,
we re-run the estimation without injecting noise to the simulations. The obtained scatter for both $z<1$ and $z>1$ are at a similar level (i.e.,  $\sim$0.15$-$0.2 dex, see Table~\ref{tab:sum}), indicating that observational errors dominate the scatter.

\item{} Regarding the \red{offsets of the scaling relation from the D20 local} ($\Delta$\mbh\ at a given \smass), all simulations generally match the observations with some subtle, yet notable, differences. While Illustris\red{, MBII,} and Horizon-AGN show good correspondence with observations at $z<0.6$, the comparisons at $z>0.6$ are better for SAM, \red{MBII,} TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN. From $z\sim0.7$ to $z\sim1.5$, TNG100, TNG300 and Horizon-AGN simulations match well the observed evolution of the scaling relation, i.e., the offsets are larger at higher redshift as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets_vz} and Table~\ref{tab:sum}. 
\red{4/6 of the simulations have decreasing mass offset from $z=0.2$ and $z=0.6$ while the observation mass offset increases with redshift all the way, despite that the offset difference between $z=0.2$ and $z=0.6$ is well below the observed scatter.}
%\todo{To add that 4/6 of the simulations have decreasing mass offsets from z=0.2 and 0.6 while the offsets from the observations increase with redshift all the way (Fig. 5). P15}
\end{enumerate}

%\todo{For clarity the first paragraph after 3) should specify the stellar mass range considered when discussing the scatter of the local relation etc.}
\red{These results are inferred by studying the sample with stellar mass mainly with the range [9.5, 11.5] $M_{\odot}$. Note that
the} absolute value of stellar masses in both observation and theory have significant uncertainty (up to factor of two)\red{. For example, for the observation, the \smass\ of the galaxies depends on the assumption of initial mass function, possibly on the implementation of star formation in the models; for the simulation, the \smass\ depends on their definition (i.e., total mass or within 30~kpc aperture), and other subgrid models such as supernova feedback, AGN feedback.} In contrast, the scatter around the mean correlation is a relative quantity, which is less affected by such systematic effect. Thus, in this work, we first consider the scatter as a diagnostic criteria to see whether some simulations match the data better than others. Taking (1) and (2), our results suggest that the tightness of the scaling relations have been formed since redshift 1.7, which is in contrast with the scenario of the central limit theorem~\citep{Peng2007, Jahnke2011, Hirschmann2010} that the scaling relation is a consequence of a stochastic cloud in the early universe with subsequent random mergers thereafter. In this stochastic scenario we expect the scatter of the scaling relations to increase towards higher redshift. In fact, the scatter level in the simulation without adding random noise is consistent with the {\it intrinsic} scatter estimations reported in~\citet{Ding2020, 2021arXiv210902751L} (i.e., $\lesssim0.35$~dex). This level is also not larger than the typical scatter of the local relations reported in the literature~\citep{Kormendy13, Gul++09, Reines2015}.

The simulations studied in this work have adopted completely different numerical techniques. However, all of them \red{have similar tightness intrinsic scaling relation and thus provide good agreement with the observation in terms of the sample dispersion}. In fact, the tightness of the scaling relation is stem from the same physics assumed in these simulations (i.e., AGN feedback). Thus, \red{our result} is {\it consistent} with the hypothesis\footnote{\red{As discussed in the Section~\ref{sec:dis}, by saying `consistent', we do not mean this hypothesis is the unique interpretation  which rule out the other possible models.}} that the AGN feedback as a causal link between \red{supermassive BH}s and their hosts plays a key role in establishing the scaling relation. 
%\todo{P18: AGN feedback, causal link?}

We can gain more insight into the role of feedback by looking at the SAM model, for which multiple feedback models have been implemented. \citet{Ding2020b} compared the scaling relations obtained with the same HST sample and the SAM simulation but with a different, isotropic, AGN feedback model, and found a larger scatter ($\sim0.7$~dex) with respect to the present SAM version ($\sim0.36$~dex). We ascribed the change to the following reasons: in the new 2D model for feedback, the wave expansions stalls along the direction of the disc, and the radius where the expansion stops depends strongly on both the gas density of the disk and the AGN luminosity. 
This means that the opening angle (and hence the fraction of expelled gas) is larger when the gas density is small (because of the lower energy that has to be spent to push the gas outwards) and when the AGN luminosity is large (because of the larger energy available to push the blast wave outwards). These dependencies are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:SAM}. 
Both quantities depend on the merging histories and are  related, since the AGN luminosity $L_{\rm AGN}$ depends on the available cold gas reservoir $M_{\rm gas}$.
The large efficiency of feedback in galaxies with particularly small $M_{\rm gas}$ (for given $L_{\rm AGN}$) or in those with particularly large $L_{\rm AGN}$
(for given $M_{\rm gas}$) inhibits the BH growth in all the host galaxies that are outliers with respect to the average relation between $M_{\rm gas}$ and $L_{\rm AGN}$. 
This results into a smaller scatter.

In theoretical models, AGN feedback is often assumed to consist of two distinct modes:
a quasar-heating mode where the \red{BH} accretion rates are comparable to the Eddington rate and a radio-jet mode occurring at low accretion rates (see, e.g., Section~\ref{subsec:Horizon}). In high redshift universe, the cold material in early universe leads to the vigorous accretion to the \red{supermassive BH} which drives the high accretion rates, and thus the quasar mode dominates the feedback. At low redshift, the star formation and feedback ejection reduce the cold material leading to a lower accretion rate and a radio-mode-dominating feedback~\citep[e.g.][]{2012MNRAS.420.2662D,2016MNRAS.460.2979V,2018MNRAS.479.4056W}. Our comparison result shows that the level of intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation at redshifts up to 1.7 is consistent with the low redshift one (see \red{Table~\ref{tab:sum})}, which reveals the fact that at high redshift the AGN feedback described by the quasar mode has already regulated the tight correlation between \red{supermassive BH} and its host galaxy. After that, the radio-jet mode starts to take control at low redshift by maintaining the tightness of the scaling relation till the level we observe today. \todo{Address referee's P19 (to talk with John). Some discussions on the two modes. I plot a figure 9 for to understand it (see Figure~\ref{fig:fedd}).}

Our work highlights the importance of applying measurement uncertainty and the effect of selection to the simulated data in order to make direct comparisons with observations. Such comparisons have been made in the local universe~\citep[e.g.,][]{Habouzit2021} where the measurements are relatively robust and the selection function is broad thus it is less crucial to ensure consistency between observations and simulations. However, beyond $z>0.2$, the scatter and the central distribution of the scaling relations are dominated by measurement uncertainty and selection effects (see Figures~\ref{fig:comparsion} and~\ref{fig:deltaMM}) and a forward modeling in the observational plane becomes essential. \red{Indeed, those effects would hamper our understanding of whether BHs and their hosts co-evolve or not. For example, from trends seen with stellar mass in Illustris and MBII (Figure~\ref{fig:deltaMM}), we found that the observations of the \mbh\ offsets as a function of \smass\  show a very different trend to the intrinsic one.}


Extending this study to even higher redshift \red{and lower mass galaxies (}\smass\ $<10^{10}M_{\odot}$) will be very beneficial, probing closer to the epoch of formation of massive galaxies and \red{supermassive BH}s. The understanding of how and when the tight scaling relation emerged are crucial to test theoretical models \citep{Volonteri2021}. On the observational side, the James Webb Space Telescope will provide high-quality imaging data of AGNs at redshift up to $z\sim7$ (i.e., JWST cycle 1 program GO-1967 and GO-1727). These upcoming measurements will represent stringent tests on the proposed physical mechanisms for the initial formation of supermassive \red{BH}s and of their subsequent evolution with galaxies.
