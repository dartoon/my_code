       (i) BH mass (unit = Msun) 
       (ii) ALMA [CII]-based dynamical mass (unit = Msun) 
       (iii) Error of (i) (unit = dex) 
       (iv) Absolute 1450A UV magnitude (unit = mag) 
       (v) flag of (i)-(ii) 
               0 = BH mass is determined from MgII 
               1 = BH mass is determined by assuming the Edd. limit accretion 
               2 = Host dynamical mass is just a upper limit (two z > 7 objects; J1342+0928 and J1120+0641) 
       (vi) Total IR luminosity (unit = Lsun; assumption: dust temperature = 47K, emissivity index beta = 1.6)
       (vii) flag of (vi) 
               0 = detected objects 
               1 = 3sigma upper limit
